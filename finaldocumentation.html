    <p>The game design has started from Tae Nim's Thesis practice: find a successful communication with audiences about my identity by symbolizing myself as a camellia flower. He wanted to present his inner space where users can freely interact by using an innovative method: Unity, game engine. The game has purposely designed in exhibition manner as a virtual installation art by using the open-world genre. He wanted the work to look like one piece of drawn work that presents in a three dimensional way that people can interact by controlling the character within the virtual space that I created. That is why he used a wet paintbrush tool from Photoshop for every objects: planets and tree, and walls. The whole area represents his inner conscious mind, so he filled up with surrealism art to express his consicous mind effectively.  Players can freely interact with asset and narration from the entire room.

      <h3>"I" Camellia Tree (2021)</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Photoshop, Watercolour, Pastel, Conte </p>
      <p>I re-created the work of art, "Caemllia (2018)," into the surrealism art by using the photoshop. The artwork shows I and camellia are the same in this space, so I am a camellia tree, and camellia tree is I. The space background is to explain that people are in a different space.
I put this picture on the ceiling because when people are trying to look at the picture, they will also see the snowfall. Camellia is the flower that blooms during the winter season. It has to overcome the cold and harsh winter to bloom its flower-like I was having many difficulties to overcome to take a journey to become an artist. Therefore, by putting the picture and snowfall in the same direction, I want people to find out about the relationship between those two elements. </p>

      <h3>"Part 1" Camellia Human (2021)</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Photoshop, Watercolour</p>
      <p>If I show the whole story with the picture on the ceiling, I wanted to keep the same tone for the sidewalls but express them in a different mood. If the "I" Camelia Tree is a full shot, "Part 1" and "Part 2" are the close-up shot. I combine Camellia flower and foot to create a surrealist mood. If "I" version used the whole tree and I, for "Part 1" and "Part 2" it will use part of the tree and human. Therefore, with camellia flower, foot, and space background, I created the surrealism artwork. </p>

      <p class="w3-opacity">Photoshop, Watercolour</p>
      <p>"Part 2" Camellia Human (2021) is the 2nd series of the Camellia human. By combining human body part and camellia flower, I draw a surrealism artwork. For this work, I painted the Camelia that has a hand. When people start the game, the first wall they will see is the front wall, so I want them to get a hint of mood and expression before they look at the ceiling. </p>

      <h3>Broken Trees (2021)</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Photoshop, Watercolour</p>
      <p>Even though the camelia tree blooms its flower, it does not mean that it did not get damaged or hurt at all. It is not easy to achieve something, the tree had to wait and overcome the patiently, but it probably had few branches were damaged or broken. Likewise, the painting represents the time that I got hurt form hardships. However, even the trees get cut, they always grow again. Therefore, it foreshadows the hurtful memory of the trees and the artist and says that pain makes us stronger.
	<hr>Moreover, because I drew this paint, I display some of the cut trees on the bottom to represent the environment: windy and snowy, because of the damage of the tree but will grow again by putting the full-grown tree.</p>

      <h5>Game Brief</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">I wanted to continue and upgrade previous work that I did earlier in Atelier 2, creating an open world to invite the audience to explore the virtual installation art that shows my identity. The previous group project developed from my Thesis practice. I wanted to keep the same concept in the middle of the design process but wanted to create my conscious world with Unity.</p><br>

      <h5>Narrative Beats</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Narrative beats are audiencesâ€™ style and identity. I am the one who created the world and came up with my story and question. Depending on people, someone might want to view the artwork, or the others want to investigate the work and desire to find out my intension. There are no happy or sad and good or bad ending, but the end could vary depending on peopleâ€™s style.</p><br>

      <h5>Plotline</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">There is no specific story plotline in this game since it is an interactive game where people can make their own story or thoughts. There will not be any given event in the game because there should not be any intention or instruction in the installation work. However, depending on the audiences,  they could have different story plotlines while interpreting their experiences while interacting with the artwork. Someone might come up with the story that only has an exposition when they have no particular thought about art. On the other hand, the other people might flashback their memory of overcoming hardships for achievement formed with all plotlines by understanding the work of art that I created. However, there are no right or wrong answer.</p><br>

      <h5>Sample Script</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">You got invited to my conscious world. You can leave any time, or you can stay as long as you want. Space and its elements represent the eternal cycle of hardships. Camellia represents my identity that overcomes harsh winter. Snow or winter represent harsh winter. Therefore, it is a story of I that I overcame difficulties to bloom the flower and based on its memory, I will overcome the upcoming one. And I am questioning you back, what do you think or feel in the space?</p><br>

      <h5>Core Loop</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><img src="diagram1.JPG" alt="Flowers in Chania" width="460" height="250"></p>

      <h5>Controls & Core Mechanics</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">- The ball will move horizontally by adding the velocity on the x-axis. The right arrow key will make the ball move positively, and the left arrow key will make a ball move in a negative value.
      <p class="w3-text-grey">- The ball will move vertically by adding the velocity on the z-axis. The up arrow key will make the ball move positively, and the down arrow key will make a ball move in a negative value.
      <p class="w3-text-grey">- There will be a camera holder script on create empty. It will detect Mouse X and Y to rotate the camera angle. Main camera will move together with Camera Holder.
    <p class="w3-text-grey">- Camera holder will copy the position of the player, so it can move with player. It has to be seperated because the camera will rotated with the ball when it moving unless I do not put them seperately.   </p><br>

    <h5>Secondary Mechanics</h5>
    <p class="w3-text-grey">While the character are moving and looking around, the particle system will keep running to create a snow.
    Planets will attracts together by writing C# code and add the physical material into the planet so it can be bouncy. </p>

      <h5>Overview</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">         While I created a field with snow and camellia from the last project, for this time, I want to add an element of surrealism to express my conscious mind effectively. Surrealism art is an art movement that artists started to draw their conscious mind or unrealistic scene like a dream. I have to use a real-life object and use them to create a romantic theme to show my identity to express my conscious mind to the audiences. Therefore, this time I will add the human face into the tree that I got inspired from my last semester project from Atelier 1 AR project where I had to create a computer-generated image filter to apply on the human face to make them look like a camellia tree when they are looking at my conscious world through a camera. Moreover, the background will be a space to place the camellia tree assets in an unbalanced atmosphere; I got inspired from my drawing for another concept picture to express my conscious world by using surrealism, and I thought it would be nice if I am trying to make that world by using Unity. I drew it for the concept picture for another project, but I could not use it since I had to change the plan, so I thought it would be nice to use it for this time and develop it further to create a polished work.
<p class="w3-text-grey"> Last project, I was trying to unite other teammates worlds with mine in a short amount of time since it was a group project. However, it did not look like an inner world that I wanted to create initially. It was more like a collaborative environment. However, while I was thinking how to upgrade the last project, I came up with the idea of using surrealist art. In conclusion, I wish assets and environment that inspired from surrealist art will allow me to get closer with my original intention and plan of the project.
